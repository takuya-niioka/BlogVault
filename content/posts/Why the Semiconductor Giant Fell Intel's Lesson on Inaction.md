## The Fall of a Technology Leader

In recent years, the power dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Intel, which once led the PC revolution alongside the "Intel Inside" logo and reigned as the absolute king of the semiconductor industry, has been overtaken in market capitalization by both TSMC and NVIDIA. Its market cap, which exceeded $200 billion in 2020, fell below $100 billion by April 2025[^1]. Meanwhile, TSMC reached $1 trillion in July 2025, and NVIDIA, riding the AI boom, became the first company in the world to exceed $5 trillion on October 29, 2025[^2].

Market share tells a similar story. In the desktop CPU market, where Intel once held over 80%, AMD has steadily gained ground, expanding to 32% by 2025[^3]. The same trend continues in data center CPUs. Most critically, Intel completely lost the next-generation computing market to NVIDIA, which became the dominant force in the AI era.

This fall didn't happen suddenly. It resulted from over a decade of accumulated strategic decisions. And this story contains important lessons for all of us working in the technology industry.

**When technological superiority crumbles, what actually kills a company?**

The answer is not the technology itself.

## The Curse of Vertical Integration Success

### Intel's Business Model: The IDM Choice

For many years, Intel adopted the IDM (Integrated Device Manufacturer)[^12] model. This is a business model where everything from semiconductor design to manufacturing is done in-house. While many competitors separated design and manufacturing, Intel stuck to this strategy.

Why did Intel cling to the IDM model? Because this model was the driving force behind Intel's success.

**The Golden Age of Vertical Integration**

From the 1970s through the 2000s, Intel's strategy was overwhelmingly correct. In an era when Moore's Law[^4] was functioning, manufacturing technology was the source of competitive advantage. By integrating design and manufacturing, Intel established the following advantages:

1. **Complete Quality Control**: Achieving the highest performance and reliability through consistent management from design to manufacturing
2. **Technical Synergy**: Manufacturing technology innovations fed back into design, enabling further performance improvements
3. **Barriers to Entry**: Massive manufacturing equipment investments made new entry virtually impossible

This strategy worked brilliantly. The "Intel Inside" brand became synonymous with quality and performance, driving the PC revolution. Manufacturing became Intel's soul and the core of its corporate culture.

### Environmental Change: The Rise of the Foundry Model

However, the situation began to change from the late 2000s. Foundry services (contract manufacturing) provided by TSMC and Samsung rapidly improved their technological capabilities. And a new business model was proven.

**Fabless + Foundry: A New Industry Structure**

AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Apple. These companies succeeded by not owning manufacturing facilities (fabless[^13]) and specializing in design. Manufacturing is outsourced to foundries[^14] like TSMC and Samsung.

The advantages of this model were clear:

1. **Capital Efficiency**: No massive investment in manufacturing facilities needed. Resources concentrated on design and marketing
2. **Flexibility**: Manufacturing volume adjustable according to demand fluctuations. Inventory risk minimized
3. **Technology Access**: Access to TSMC's cutting-edge processes. No need to develop in-house

NVIDIA's success was particularly symbolic. By not owning manufacturing facilities, it concentrated on GPU design and building a software ecosystem (CUDA). As a result, it became the dominant force in the AI era.

### Intel's Choice: Clinging to Manufacturing

How did Intel respond to this structural change? The answer: "persistence."

Letting go of manufacturing wasn't just a strategic change for Intel. It meant denying the company's identity. Manufacturing technology built over decades, massive equipment investments, and above all, the corporate culture that "manufacturing is Intel's strength."

All of these became factors preventing strategic transformation.

But the environment became even harsher. Around 2015, Intel began to be overtaken by TSMC in manufacturing technology. Significantly delayed in developing the 10nm process, the technology gap widened with each generation: 7nm, 5nm, 3nm[^5].

**The Sunk Cost Trap[^15]**

Massive investments in manufacturing equipment distort decision-making. Not wanting to waste the tens of billions of dollars already invested. Wishful thinking that "if we try a little harder, we can catch up." And the fear that "if we let go of manufacturing, Intel will have nothing left."

Thus, Intel continued to choose the option of "maintaining the status quo." But when the environment is changing, maintaining the status quo is the most dangerous choice.

## The Moment "Status Quo" Became the Worst Option

### Two Simultaneous Changes

Intel didn't face a single environmental change. Two major structural changes occurred simultaneously.

**Change A: Manufacturing Model Transformation**
- IDM (vertical integration) → Fabless + Foundry (horizontal specialization)
- Intel's manufacturing technology advantage disappeared
- TSMC took the lead in manufacturing technology

**Change B: Market Transformation**
- CPU-centric → GPU/AI accelerator-centric
- PC market maturation
- Rapid growth of data center and AI markets

These two changes simultaneously attacked both wheels of Intel's business model. Losing manufacturing advantage while the market itself was shifting. Yet Intel's response was consistently "status quo."

### Why Choose Status Quo

The reasons organizations choose status quo are always the same:

**1. Attachment to Sunk Costs**
Manufacturing facilities requiring massive investment. The psychology of "we've invested this much, we can't quit now." But when the environment changes, past investments cannot be recovered.

**2. Clinging to Success Stories**
"The CPU is the heart of the computer." This belief was correct. But that was in the past. In the AI era, the GPU is the new heart.

**3. Underestimating Competition**
NVIDIA's success was dismissed as a "niche market." "Gaming GPUs can't possibly dominate data centers." This judgment was the fatal error.

**4. Organizational Culture Rigidity**
The culture that "manufacturing is Intel" prevented strategic transformation. The manufacturing division's political influence was strong, even suppressing discussions of going fabless.

### The Cost of Status Quo

The cost of choosing status quo increases exponentially over time.

**What clinging to manufacturing brought:**
- Delays in developing 10nm and 7nm processes
- Widening technology gap with TSMC (more than 2 generations behind)
- Continuous losses in the manufacturing division
- Inability to bring competitive products to market

**What clinging to CPUs brought:**
- Complete defeat to NVIDIA in the GPU market
- Delayed entry into the AI accelerator market
- Declining share in the data center market
- Failed to become the protagonist of the AI era

And as a result of all this: In 2025, Intel was far behind TSMC and NVIDIA in market capitalization. The former king became the pursuer.

### What Would Andy Grove Have Said

Ironically, Intel had a manager who foresaw this situation. Andy Grove, Intel's legendary CEO. In his book "Only the Paranoid Survive"[^6], he proposed the concept of "Strategic Inflection Point."

**What is a Strategic Inflection Point:**
The moment when a company's competitive environment fundamentally changes and past success formulas no longer work. Missing this moment leads companies down the path of decline.

Grove actually boldly transformed Intel from the memory chip business to the microprocessor business[^7]. At the time, memory was Intel's main product, but it was losing competitiveness to Japanese companies' offensive. Grove courageously decided to withdraw and bet on CPUs. This decision grew Intel into a global company.

However, Intel in the 2010s had forgotten Grove's teachings. Facing two strategic inflection points—manufacturing and CPUs—it chose to maintain the status quo.

**"Be Paranoid"**

Grove's words mean to always be vigilant about environmental changes and not fear self-transformation. But the more successful an organization becomes, the more it loses this vigilance. The arrogance that "we are special" and "our business model is robust."

Intel was killed by the success formula it built.

## Three Strategies Intel Should Have Taken

So what should Intel have done? Looking back at the past may be meaningless. But learning from this has value for all of us working in every industry.

Intel had at least three strategic options.

### Strategy A: Early Withdrawal (Going Fabless from Manufacturing)

**Timing: Around 2015**

When TSMC began to overtake in manufacturing technology, Intel should have decided to withdraw from manufacturing.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Stop new investments in manufacturing facilities
2. Gradually reduce or sell existing manufacturing sites
3. Build strategic partnership with TSMC
4. Concentrate resources on design and software
5. Invest fully in GPU/AI accelerator development

**Success Case: AMD's Revival**

Actually, there's a success example of this strategy. AMD.

In the early 2010s, AMD was defeated in competition with Intel and fell into a management crisis. However, when Lisa Su became CEO in 2014, she executed a bold strategic transformation[^8].

- Spun off manufacturing division (GlobalFoundries)
- Specialized in design, developed Zen architecture
- Utilized TSMC's cutting-edge processes
- Result: From 2017 onward, rapidly recovered market share with Ryzen and EPYC

AMD's market capitalization grew from $2 billion in 2015 to over $400 billion in 2025. That's 200 times[^9].

**Why Couldn't Intel Do This:**

AMD had its back against the wall. It didn't have the strength to continue manufacturing. But Intel was different. It had the capacity to invest in manufacturing facilities and continued to hold hope that "if we try a little harder, we can catch up."

And there was organizational culture. For Intel, manufacturing wasn't just a business division but the company's identity itself. Letting go of manufacturing meant ceasing to be Intel.

Pride, sunk costs, and fear. These prevented rational strategic judgment.

### Strategy B: Change the Rules of the Game (Full Entry into GPU/AI Market)

**Timing: Around 2010**

When NVIDIA began deploying GPUs to data center and AI markets, Intel should have decided to fully enter this market.

**Actually Attempted: History of Failures**

Intel actually attempted to enter the GPU market. But all failed.

**Larrabee Project (2008-2010)**
- GPU architecture based on CPU technology
- Result: Product launch canceled due to insufficient performance
- Cause: Didn't understand the fundamental design philosophy differences between GPUs and CPUs

**Integrated GPU (Intel HD Graphics)**
- Graphics functionality integrated into CPU
- Result: Low performance, insufficient for gaming or AI applications
- Cause: Positioned as CPU accessory. Lacked serious commitment

**Xe GPU (2020)**
- Independent GPU for data centers
- Result: Couldn't compete with NVIDIA, no market presence
- Cause: Entry too late. Completely defeated in software ecosystem

**Why It Failed: Half-hearted Commitment**

Intel's problem was positioning the GPU business as "complementary to CPU." Protecting the CPU business while working on GPUs half-heartedly. There was no way to beat NVIDIA this way.

The essence of NVIDIA's success lies not in hardware but in its software ecosystem. CUDA (GPU development environment) is NVIDIA's true competitive advantage[^10]. All AI researchers use CUDA. Intel didn't understand this decade-plus of advance investment.

**To Succeed:**
1. Concentrate management resources on GPU/AI even at the expense of CPU business
2. Long-term investment in software ecosystem
3. Building developer community
4. Cultural transformation to "Intel is an AI company"

But this was organizationally impossible. The CPU division's political power was too strong. The GPU business was always secondary.

### Strategy C: Buy Time and Prepare for the Next Battlefield

**The Strategy Intel Is Currently Taking (But Too Late)**

Having recognized it can't win in either manufacturing or GPUs, Intel is now taking a "buy time" strategy.

**Specific Actions:**
1. Concentrated investment in next-generation technologies
   - Quantum computing
   - Photonics (optical communication technology)
   - 3D stacking technology
2. Utilizing government support
   - CHIPS Act (U.S. government semiconductor support)
   - Reshoring manufacturing sites
3. Entry into foundry service business
   - Intel Foundry Services (contract manufacturing for other companies)
   - Imitating TSMC's business model

**Problem: Buying Time Requires Current Profits**

The fatal weakness of this strategy is that buying time requires funds. And Intel's current business is in the red.

- Continuously losing share to AMD in CPU market
- Struggling in data center market
- Manufacturing division posting massive losses
- No presence in AI market

Investment in the future requires current cash flow. But that's drying up.

**If This Strategy Had Been Taken 10 Years Ago:**

Around 2015, Intel still had sufficient profitability. If at that point it had accelerated investment in next-generation technologies and given up on the CPU/manufacturing battle, it might be seeing a different landscape now.

But the illusion that "we can still win" delayed strategic transformation. And now, options are severely constrained.

## When Environmental Change Occurs, Status Quo Is the Most Dangerous Option

### Intel's Lessons: Three Pitfalls

What can we learn from Intel's decline?

**Pitfall 1: Past Success Becomes Future Shackles**

"Manufacturing is Intel's strength." "The CPU is the center of computing." These beliefs were once correct. But now that the environment has changed, they've become shackles.

The more successful a company, the more it falls into this trap. Because past success stories are powerful evidence. The fact that "this method succeeded" is hard to refute.

But when the environment changes, past success formulas don't work. Rather, clinging to them invites failure.

**Pitfall 2: Fixation on "Core Competence" Narrows Vision**

Management studies teach "focus on core competence." Concentrate resources on your strengths and abandon the rest. This is correct strategy.

But when the environment changes, "core competence" itself can become obsolete. Intel's manufacturing technology was certainly a core competence. But with TSMC's rise, it was no longer a competitive advantage.

Fixation on core competence makes new opportunities invisible. The self-perception that "we are a manufacturing company" eliminates options like "specialize in design" or "differentiate through software."

**Pitfall 3: Recognizing Environmental Change But Unable to Change Behavior**

Most frightening is that Intel's management recognized the environmental change. They knew about TSMC's rise and NVIDIA's success.

The problem is the gap between recognition and action.

Why couldn't they change behavior? Organizational inertia. In huge organizations, changing strategy is not easy. Manufacturing division employment, justifying existing investments, explaining to shareholders, and above all, cultural transformation.

All of these become factors preventing strategic transformation. The result is the worst situation: "we understand but can't change."

### Strategic Choice Framework During Environmental Change

So how can we avoid following Intel's path? I propose a decision-making framework for when environmental change occurs.

**Step 1: Diagnosis - Is Our Advantage Still Functioning?**

Periodically ask yourself these questions:

- What is the source of our competitive advantage?
- Compared to 3 years ago, is that advantage getting stronger or weaker?
- Are competitors succeeding with different business models?
- Is market growth in our product category or in a different category?

Answering these questions honestly is the first step. Intel should have answered these questions honestly around 2010.

**Step 2: Judgment - Four Strategic Options**

Once you recognize environmental change, consider these four options:

**Option 1: Status Quo**
- Applicable condition: Environmental change is temporary, company's advantage still valid
- Risk: If change is structural, you'll fall irretrievably behind
- Intel's case: Worst choice

**Option 2: Early Withdrawal**
- Applicable condition: Company's advantage lost, no prospect of recovery
- Benefit: Can reallocate resources to new opportunities
- AMD's case: Withdrew from manufacturing, concentrated on design

**Option 3: Game Change**
- Applicable condition: New market opportunity exists, company assets can be repurposed
- Risk: Cannibalization with existing business
- NVIDIA's case: Shifted GPUs from gaming to AI

**Option 4: Buying Time**
- Applicable condition: Possibility of reversal with next-generation technology, can secure funds with current business
- Risk: Possibility of running out of time
- Intel's present: Too late

**Step 3: Execution - Once Decided, Act Swiftly and Thoroughly**

Most important is execution after decision. Half-hearted execution brings the worst results.

- If you decide to withdraw, withdraw thoroughly (AMD's manufacturing spinoff)
- If you decide to transform, boldly reallocate management resources (NVIDIA's CUDA investment)
- If you decide to buy time, execute cost reductions decisively

Intel's failure was hesitation at this execution stage. Half-hearted investment in GPU business, incomplete withdrawal from manufacturing, hesitation to shrink CPU business. All of these caused missed opportunities.

### From Stagnation to Revival: Three Conditions for Organizations to Begin Changing

Intel's case is often portrayed as a "structure of decline," but what's important is the perspective of **how revival is possible**. Let's think backward from Intel's failures about the conditions necessary for mature organizations to start moving again.

**Condition 1: Visualizing Crisis - Speak with Numbers**

Organizations move not when crisis is "felt" but when it's "measured." Intel's management in the 2010s recognized TSMC's threat. But it wasn't visualized to a level that would spread throughout the organization and prompt action.

What's needed:
- Benchmarks quantitatively showing technology gap with competitors
- Tracking market share trends every quarter
- Analysis of customer churn rate and reasons
- Simulation of "what happens in 3 years if we continue like this"

Numbers don't allow excuses. Visualized crisis is the first step to moving an organization.

**Condition 2: Allowing Experimentation - Try Small and Learn**

One of Intel's problems was seeking too much for "the decisive move." Entry into GPU business and starting foundry services all began as "large projects that must succeed."

But in highly uncertain environments, **accumulation of small experiments** is more effective than big bets.

- Give new businesses independence as "spinoffs"
- Try multiple approaches in parallel, assuming failure (Reference article: [Decision-Making Under Uncertainty: The 70% Rule](/posts/decision-making-under-uncertainty-70-percent-rule/))
- Evaluate results quarterly and make withdrawal decisions quickly
- Boldly reallocate resources to successful experiments

What AMD's Lisa Su executed was exactly this approach. While betting on the single hypothesis of Zen architecture, she conducted experiments in parallel across multiple battlefields: server market (EPYC), desktop market (Ryzen), and gaming console market (PS5/Xbox).

**Condition 3: Cultural Transformation - From "Correctness" to "Speed"**

Most difficult is cultural transformation. In successful companies like Intel, "making correct decisions" is emphasized. Thorough analysis, perfect planning, consensus of all stakeholders.

But in an era of rapid environmental change, **speed is more important than correctness**. 

Concrete actions for cultural transformation:
- Simplify decision-making processes (reduce approval layers)
- Incorporate "hypothesis-verification cycles" into organizational KPIs
- Design systems that don't blame failure but evaluate learning
- Management itself demonstrates "course correction"

What Intel is next being asked about is not technology but **institutional design for change**. And this is a challenge all mature companies face.

### Implications for the Automotive Industry

This analysis has direct implications for the ADAS/automotive industry. Because the automotive industry now faces the same structural change Intel faced in the 2010s.

**Two Simultaneous Changes:**

1. **Powertrain Transformation**: Internal combustion engine → Electric motor
2. **Value Source Transformation**: Hardware → Software

And the rise of new players: Tesla, Chinese EV manufacturers, and semiconductor/AI companies (NVIDIA, Mobileye).

**Similarities with Intel:**

- Long-standing vertical integration model (making everything in-house)
- Massive investment in engine technology (sunk cost)
- Belief that "automobiles are hardware"
- Underestimating new players

In fact, Intel acquired Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, entering the autonomous driving market[^11]. And Mobileye's chips are manufactured by TSMC. Even Intel's ADAS business doesn't use its own manufacturing.

**What's Being Asked:**

What should automakers learn to avoid following Intel's path?

- Continue investing in internal combustion engines or withdraw early?
- Develop software in-house or partner with specialized companies?
- Can they redefine the identity of "what is an automaker"?

No one has the one and only correct answer to these questions. But it's certain that the option of status quo is the most dangerous.

## Is Your Industry at a "Strategic Inflection Point"?

### Final Questions

I pose three questions to you reading this article:

**Question 1: Is Your Industry Facing Structural Change?**

- Is new technology threatening existing business models?
- Are new players succeeding with different approaches?
- Is market growth shifting from traditional products to new product categories?

**Question 2: Is Your Company Aiming for "Status Quo"?**

- Are you making strategy based on past success stories?
- Is fixation on "core competence" making new opportunities invisible?
- Are you postponing concrete action while recognizing environmental change?

**Question 3: How Will You Act?**

Changing organizations is difficult. But you yourself can change.

- Will your skill set still have value in 5 years?
- Are you investing time to learn new domains?
- Are you facing change actively rather than defensively?

**Andy Grove's Words:**

> "Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive."

### What Intel's Story Teaches

Intel's decline is not someone else's problem. Every industry, every company will someday stand at the same crossroads. Technological superiority is not eternal. Markets change, business models become obsolete.

The question is not "will change occur" but "how will we respond when change occurs."

What Intel taught us is the harsh reality that organizations that recognize environmental change but can't change behavior will perish. Past success stories, sunk costs, organizational culture. All of these prevent rational decision-making.

But at the same time, AMD and NVIDIA prove that companies that adapt to change prosper.

**The option of status quo is actually the same as choosing "gradual death."**

The time to courageously transform strategy may be now. And each time you postpone that decision, your options decrease.

Intel's story isn't over yet. There's possibility of revival with next-generation technology. But the loss of 10 precious years is irretrievable.

**The mistake Intel made is not someone else's problem.**

Even today, aren't we choosing optimization within existing frameworks and postponing change? In meeting rooms, "correctness" is debated, in the field, "precedent" is referenced, and before we know it, the market has started moving elsewhere.

For mature companies to start moving again, what's needed is not meetings debating correctness but **transformation into organizations that move hypotheses**. What Intel is next being asked about is not technology but **institutional design for change**.

And that may apply to your organization too.

An era where **the speed of will** is questioned more than technology.

Where do your company, your industry, and you yourself stand now?
