## Why We Succumb to Short-Term Temptations

As we saw in [Defining Vision: Strategic Choice from Past Success & Failure](/posts/how-to-define-vision-strategic-choice/), there are three temptations in vision definition: competitor following, market voices, and technological possibilities. Using these as decision criteria seems rational at first glance. However, following them generally distances us from essence and long-term success.

Why do we succumb to these temptations? The root cause lies in human cognitive characteristics and organizational structure.

### The Constraint of Cognitive Biases

As Daniel Kahneman demonstrated in his book[^3], our judgments are known to be dominated by unconscious biases. The human brain was designed through evolution to prioritize short-term survival, and tends to be inherently poor at long-term thinking.

#### Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias makes us seek information confirming our beliefs while ignoring contradictions. We remember "competitors are investing in AI," but overlook statistics showing "90% of AI investments fail."

#### Status Quo Bias

Status quo bias makes us overestimate the risks of change. Research shows[^4] that people choose the status quo in 36-57% of cases (theoretical value is 25-33%). Intel's maintenance of its vertical integration model, as seen in [Why the Semiconductor Giant Fell: Intel's Lesson on Inaction](/posts/stagnation-is-the-worst-decision/), is a typical example.

#### Social Proof

Social proof, as Robert Cialdini showed in his book[^5], makes us feel that "what everyone is doing" is correct. If three competitors adopt LiDAR, we feel we should too—but all three could easily be wrong.

#### Present Bias

Present bias makes us value immediate rewards over larger future rewards. Behavioral economics research shows that "10% sales increase this year" is more likely to be chosen than "30% market share increase in 5 years."

These biases form the biological and psychological foundation for succumbing to short-term temptations.

### Organizational Structure as an Amplifier

Individual biases are further amplified by organizational structure.

#### Quarterly Reporting as Short-Term Pressure

Public companies' quarterly reporting systems institutionally reinforce shareholder short-termism. With performance announcements every three months, "this quarter's sales" are prioritized over "competitive strength in 5 years." With average CEO tenure around 7 years, stock price increases during tenure tend to be prioritized over long-term vision realization.

This pressure directly affects decision-making. "R&D investment to enhance competitiveness in 3 years" becomes less likely to be chosen than "cost reduction to protect this quarter's profits."

#### Competitive Comparison as Imitation Pressure

Organizations emphasize competitive analysis. In management meetings, information like "Competitor A took this strategy" or "The industry leader invested in this technology" becomes the center of discussion.

While this information sharing is useful, the problem is that it easily leads directly to the conclusion "competitors are doing it, so we should too." Verification of our own situation and essential value gets skipped, and competitor following becomes justified.

#### Evaluation Systems as Guidance Toward Flashiness

In many organizations, the "visibility" of results affects evaluation. "Flashy, newsworthy new feature releases" are more likely to catch the attention of managers and executives and be evaluated positively than "modest but essential quality improvements."

This evaluation bias shifts member behavior from "what's essentially right" to "what gets evaluated."

#### Risk-Averse Culture as Safety Orientation

Organizations have an asymmetry where "responsibility for failure is clear, but responsibility for opportunity loss is ambiguous." If a new challenge fails, you're held accountable, but opportunity loss from not challenging isn't visualized.

This structure favors safe, precedented choices over innovative but risky ones. Intel's continued maintenance of its vertical integration model can be considered partly due to this organizational risk aversion.

These organizational structures amplify individual cognitive biases and further strengthen short-term temptations.

### The Trap of Analogical Thinking - Thought Patterns That Don't Think for Yourself

The biggest problem created by cognitive biases and organizational structure is **dependence on reasoning by analogy**.

Analogical thinking is a thought method that makes judgments by referencing "past cases" or "others' actions." Rather than thinking from essence with your own mind, it tries to reach solutions quickly. While efficient and effective for everyday judgments, it becomes a fatal flaw in strategic decisions.

This analogical thinking manifests as three short-term temptations.

#### Temptation 1: Competitor Following (Imitating Others' Actions)

- "Competitors are investing in AI → We should too"
- "The industry leader is taking this strategy → We should copy it"
- "Three companies adopted LiDAR → We should adopt it too"

Analogies that imitate competitors' decisions. However, competitors and our company have different situations. Competitors might also be wrong. We're not thinking with our own minds about "Is this really necessary?"

#### Temptation 2: Market Voices (Following Past/Present Needs)

- "Customer surveys requested X → Let's build X"
- "The market demands it, so we should do it"

This appears customer-oriented, but markets can only articulate current needs.

As Henry Ford's words show—"If I had asked customers, they would have said 'faster horses'"—future visions aren't found through market research.

In the 2007 smartphone market, BlackBerry with physical keyboards was mainstream, but Steve Jobs ignored market voices saying "touchscreens are hard to use" and created the iPhone, creating a new market.

Listening to market voices and understanding essential market needs are different. We're not thinking with our own minds about "What are the essential needs?"

#### Temptation 3: Technological Possibility (Confusing What's Possible with What Should Be Done)

- "This technology is implementable → Let's do it"
- "Company Y succeeded with this technology → We'll succeed if we use it too"

Analogies that imitate other companies' success cases. However, "can do" and "should do" are different. Success factors aren't just technology. We're not thinking with our own minds about "Does this align with our vision?"

#### Why Is Analogical Thinking So Powerful?

Analogical thinking becomes even more powerful when combined with cognitive biases. **Confirmation bias** turns the analogy "three competitors adopted it" into conviction, **social proof** justifies the analogy "everyone's doing it," and **status quo bias** makes us cling to the analogy "past success patterns."

As a result, we try to reach solutions quickly without "thinking from essence with our own minds." This is the trap of short-term thinking.

### Purpose of This Article

So how can we overcome cognitive biases and organizational pressure to define vision with a long-term perspective? The key lies in two thinking methods:

1. **First Principles Thinking** - The thinking method Elon Musk uses to question assumptions and return to essence
2. **Regret Minimization Framework** - The decision method Jeff Bezos uses to minimize regret with a long-term perspective

This article will deep-dive into these two and integrate them.

![Short-term temptation vs long-term value](figures/Short-term temptation vs long-term value.svg)

## What Is First Principles Thinking?

### Elon Musk's Approach

Elon Musk is one of the world's most innovative entrepreneurs. Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink. Each overturned existing common sense.

The core of his thinking method is "First Principles Thinking."

**First Principles Thinking:**
A thinking method that breaks down complex problems to the most fundamental truths (first principles) and reconstructs from there.
It questions existing assumptions and customs, continuously asking "Is this really correct?"

### SpaceX Example: Are Rockets Really Expensive?

#### Questioning Industry Common Sense

In 2002, Musk tried to start a rocket company, SpaceX. However, rockets are very expensive—billions to tens of billions of yen per unit.

Conventional thinking (analogical thinking): "Rockets are expensive. Therefore, only the wealthy can do space business."

#### Breaking Down to First Principles

Musk's question: "Are rockets really expensive?"

Step 1: Break down rockets into components (aluminum, titanium, copper, electronic parts)
Step 2: Research market prices of each element
Step 3: Calculate material costs → **About 2% of rocket price**

#### Reconstructing from Zero

Conclusion: "Rockets are cheap in terms of material costs. What's expensive is the manufacturing process and organizational inefficiency."

Musk fundamentally reconsidered the manufacturing process through vertical integration, reusable rockets, and mass production, **reducing rocket costs to 1/10**.

### Tesla Example: Are Electric Vehicles Really Impossible?

#### Questioning Existing Assumptions

In the early 2000s, electric vehicles were considered "impractical." Short range, long charging time, high cost.

Conventional thinking: "Electric vehicles aren't practical. Therefore, improving gasoline cars (hybrids) is realistic."

#### Breaking Down into Elements

Musk's question: "Are electric vehicles really impossible?"

Step 1: Break down challenges into elements (battery cost, density, charging infrastructure)
Step 2: Think about each element from first principles
- Battery material costs are 1/7 of market price → Manufacturing process and scale issue
- Battery density is evolving technologically → Can improve through better packaging
- Home charging + strategic fast-charging stations are sufficient

Step 3: Reconstruct solution
- Mass production at Gigafactory → Cost reduction
- Large-capacity battery pack + efficient powertrain
- Build Supercharger network in-house

As a result, Tesla created practical electric vehicles and transformed the automotive industry.

### The 3 Steps of First Principles Thinking - And the Most Important 4th Step

From Musk's examples, we can see the process of first principles thinking. However, there's a huge gap that's hard to see here.

**Step 1: Break down the problem into elements**
Break down complex problems into physical, chemical, and economic basic elements. Not existing classifications, but essential components.

**Step 2: Question assumptions about each element**
"Is this a law of physics, or a constraint humans created?" Gravity and energy conservation laws can't be changed, but industry customs, manufacturing processes, and organizational structures can.

**Step 3: Reconstruct from zero**
Discard existing solutions and reconstruct optimal solutions from first principles.

### The "Easier Said Than Done" Problem - Why Questioning Assumptions Alone Doesn't Lead to Innovation

Reading this far, you might think: "I also question assumptions. But I don't generate Musk-like innovations. Why?"

This is an extremely essential question. In fact, first principles thinking has **a hard-to-see 4th step**.

**Step 4: Understand feasibility constraints and build a bridge to implementation**

There's a huge gap between "calculating rockets at material cost makes them cheap" and "actually realizing that."

To bridge this gap requires:
- Acquiring domain knowledge
- Power to involve people with compelling vision
- Resolve to take risks and iterate continuously

The reason you or your seniors don't achieve innovation even when questioning assumptions might be the lack of this 4th step. "Questioning assumptions" is the starting point, not the destination.

### Difference from Critical Thinking - Why First Principles Thinking Is Unique

Here's an important question: "Questioning assumptions," "asking WHY," "thinking about essence"—these thinking methods have existed for a long time. Critical thinking, 5 Whys, essential thinking. Many companies say "question assumptions" and "think until it becomes simple."

So what's different about first principles thinking?

**Difference from Critical Thinking and 5 Whys:**

Critical thinking ends at "questioning assumptions." 5 Whys repeats "why?" five times to find root causes. However, the process of "constructing new solutions" from there isn't explicitly stated.

Example: "Why are rockets expensive?" → 5 Whys reaches "because manufacturing processes are inefficient." But there's no reconstruction step like "therefore, reduce to 1/10 through vertical integration, reusable rockets, and mass production."

**Three Characteristics of First Principles Thinking:**

1. **Reduce to physical laws**: Not just "questioning assumptions," but breaking down to "distinguishing between physical laws and human-created constraints."

2. **Reconstruct from zero base**: Completely discard existing solutions and redesign optimal solutions from first principles. Don't stop at "manufacturing processes are inefficient"—construct concrete solutions.

3. **Build a bridge to implementation (4th step)**: Acquire domain knowledge, involve people with compelling vision, take risks, and iteratively implement in the right direction.

**Why "Question Assumptions" Doesn't Work in Many Companies:**

Critical thinking finds "current problems." However, what's lacking is "courage and skill to reconstruct from zero," "thoroughness to reduce to physical law level," and "resource mobilization power needed for implementation." So it ends at just "questioned assumptions," and innovation doesn't emerge.

### Application Example to System Development (Thought Experiment)

Let's consider how to apply first principles thinking to system development with a hypothetical example.

**Question: "Should we develop new feature X?"**

**Analogical thinking (common pattern):**
"Competitors are implementing it → We should develop it too"

**Applying First Principles Thinking:**

Step 1: Break down problem into elements
- Technical feasibility: Is it implementable, what are technical risks
- Economic rationality: Development cost vs expected return
- User value: Does it meet essential needs
- Organizational fit: Can we leverage our strengths

Step 2: Question assumptions about each element
Is the assumption "competitors implemented it = we need it too" really true?
→ Competitors and we might have different user bases
→ Competitors might also be wrong

Is the assumption "technically possible = should do" really true?
→ What's possible and what should be done are different

Is the assumption "the market demands it" really true?
→ Current needs and essential needs might differ

Step 3: Reconstruct from zero
Starting from "What are users' essential needs?", design the optimal solution.

Step 4: Build a bridge to implementation
- Research and acquire necessary technology stack
- Validation with prototype
- Persuade team and secure resources
- Phased implementation plan

This thought process is a tool to avoid competitor following and focus on essential value.

(Note: This is an explanation of thinking methods and doesn't recommend specific company strategies.)

### The Real Wall of Execution Power

With training, anyone can actually approach essence through first principles thinking. Questioning assumptions, breaking down into elements, reconstructing from zero—this thought process itself is learnable.

**So why doesn't thinking alone generate innovation?**

The answer is the wall of **execution power**.

#### The Difference Between Drawing Vision and Realizing It

- **Drawing blueprints**: Deriving the conclusion "$500/kg launch is possible" from first principles
- **Realizing**: Shaping the design, succeeding through repeated failures, building an organization, changing the industry

Between these two lies an overwhelming difference.

#### Three Elements of Execution Power

**1. Power to involve people** - Persuading engineers, convincing investors, moving teams

**2. Power to endure failure** - Mental strength to analyze failures, improve, and repeatedly re-challenge

**3. Long-term commitment** - Committing to vision realization over decades without wavering

#### The Real Value of First Principles Thinking

The real value of first principles thinking is **directing execution power in the right direction**.

Running full speed in the wrong direction produces no results. First principles thinking is a tool to find the "right direction."

However, even knowing the right direction, without **execution power to keep running full speed toward it**, nothing changes.

That's why we need to manage execution risks with the 70% rule from [Decision-Making Under Uncertainty: The 70% Rule](/posts/decision-making-under-uncertainty-70-percent-rule/) and the 5-Layer Framework from [Beyond Frameworks: How to Define ADAS Product Strategy When All Assumptions Are Uncertain](/posts/beyond-frameworks-adas-strategy-under-uncertainty/), and involve people with organizational penetration techniques from [The Art of Implementing Vision: Bridging Definition to Execution](/posts/vision-implementation-bridging-definition-to-execution/).

First principles thinking is the starting point. The goal is execution.

## Regret Minimization Framework: Making Decisions with Long-Term Perspective

### Bezos's 80-Year-Old Thought Experiment

In a Princeton University speech, Bezos talked about his thought process when founding Amazon[^2].

In 1994, at age 30 and successful on Wall Street, he faced the decision to found Amazon. Those around him opposed: "Don't abandon stability."

He used this thought experiment:

**"What will my 80-year-old self regret?"**

- If staying on Wall Street: The question "What if I had founded Amazon?" would remain forever
- If founding Amazon: Even if it failed, the fact that "I challenged" wouldn't be regretted

Conclusion: **"I'll regret not challenging. Therefore, I'll found it."**

This is the **Regret Minimization Framework**.

#### Time Horizon Changes Decisions

The core of this framework is **setting the time horizon**.

- **Short-term perspective (1-2 years)**: Risks stand out, tend toward safe choices
- **Long-term perspective (entire life)**: Opportunity loss from not challenging becomes visible, choices that minimize regret become clear

An important discovery from psychological research: **Long-term, "regret for not doing" is stronger and lasts longer**. The pain of failure fades with time, but the question "What if, back then..." is said to remain for life.

#### 3-Step Practice Method

**Step 1: Imagine your 80-year-old self**
Stand not from "one year later" but from the perspective of looking back on your entire life

**Step 2: Write out regrets for both scenarios**
- If I make this decision, what will I regret?
- If I don't, what will I regret?

**Step 3: Choose the one with less regret**
In many cases, "regret from challenging and failing" < "regret from not challenging"

#### Application to Management Decisions

According to public information, Bezos is said to use this framework in Amazon management as well.

**Early 2000s: Should we start AWS?**

At the time, Amazon was an online retailer. AWS was a completely different business, requiring huge investment with high failure risk.

Similar thought experiment: "Will my 80-year-old self regret not starting AWS?"

Result: Started AWS. Currently, AWS generates most of Amazon's profits.

#### Practical Considerations

This framework is **used only for important strategic decisions and life crossroads**. It's unnecessary for everyday decisions.

Also, just because you "won't regret it long-term" doesn't mean you should ignore short-term risks. Combine with the 5-Layer Framework from [Beyond Frameworks: How to Define ADAS Product Strategy When All Assumptions Are Uncertain](/posts/beyond-frameworks-adas-strategy-under-uncertainty/) and the 70% rule from [Decision-Making Under Uncertainty: The 70% Rule](/posts/decision-making-under-uncertainty-70-percent-rule/) to manage risks while challenging.

Also, **the regret minimization framework doesn't justify reckless risks.**

Sacrificing family or abandoning sound risk management because "I won't regret it long-term" is wrong in most cases.

**Humbly, yet courageously, minimize regret**. This is the essence.

---
## Integrating the Two Approaches

First principles thinking and regret minimization framework. How do these two relate?

### Problems the Two Approaches Solve

**Problem First Principles Thinking Solves:** "What is essentially correct?"

Questions assumptions and finds essential value. Eliminates short-term temptations (competitor following, market voices, technological possibilities).

**Problem Regret Minimization Framework Solves:** "Why should we do this now?"

Determines decision priorities with long-term perspective. Gives courage to challenge without worrying about short-term losses or evaluations.

### Integration Framework

Integrating the two approaches creates a powerful framework.

By combining them, we approach realizing Principle 1 "Don't compete on competitors' turf," Principle 2 "Essential value over flashiness," and Principle 3 "Leverage past success formulas" from [Defining Vision: Strategic Choice from Past Success & Failure](/posts/how-to-define-vision-strategic-choice/).

### Integration Example in System Development Strategy (Hypothetical Case)

#### Situation: Prioritizing New Feature A vs Quality Improvement B

Which should be prioritized: new feature A or quality improvement B?

#### Applying First Principles Thinking

Question: "What are users' essential needs?"

Breakdown:
- Want a stable, usable system
- Want to improve efficiency with new features
- Want a long-term reliable product

Essence of Feature A:
- Flashy and appealing
- Technically implementable
- But has reliability risks

Essence of Quality Improvement B:
- Modest and inconspicuous
- Improves existing feature reliability
- Gains users' long-term trust

Reconstruction: "Essential need is reliability. Quality improvement B has higher essential value than flashy feature A."

#### Applying Regret Minimization

Question: "Which decision won't I regret in 10 years?"

Scenario A: Prioritize Feature A
- Short-term: Generates buzz, increases sales
- Long-term: Lose trust due to quality issues
- Regret: "Why did I choose flashiness?"

Scenario B: Prioritize Quality Improvement B
- Short-term: Modest, hard to evaluate
- Long-term: User trust, brand value
- Regret: "Focusing on quality was the right choice"

Conclusion: "Prioritize quality improvement B. Even if modest short-term, won't regret it in 10 years."

#### Integrated Vision

"Provide reliable systems to all users"

- Essential value: Reliability (realized through quality improvement B)
- Long-term perspective: Choice to be proud of in 10 years
- Resistance to short-term temptations: Not swayed by flashy features

### Why Integration Is Powerful

First principles thinking alone is insufficient. Even knowing "quality improvement B is essentially correct," you might succumb to short-term evaluation pressure ("increase sales with flashy features").

Regret minimization alone is also insufficient. Even thinking "let's make choices I won't regret in 10 years," without judgment criteria for what's essentially correct, you might proceed in the wrong direction.

However, **combining both**:
- First principles thinking shows the **direction** that "quality improvement B is essentially correct"
- Regret minimization gives the **courage** to "maintain long-term perspective without succumbing to short-term pressure"
- Result: Enables firm decisions to "proceed in the essentially correct direction without wavering"

In the above example, first principles thinking teaches "reliability is essence," and regret minimization assures "I'll be proud of prioritizing quality in 10 years." Only when these two align can we reject short-term temptations (flashy feature A) and focus on essential value (quality improvement B).

## Practical Checklist

### When Defining Vision

Use integrated with the 3 principles from [Defining Vision: Strategic Choice from Past Success & Failure](/posts/how-to-define-vision-strategic-choice/).

- [ ] **Question essence with first principles**: Question assumptions like "because competitors are doing it" or "the market demands it," break down root causes of user challenges
- [ ] **Question regret with long-term perspective**: "Will I be proud of creating this system in 10 years?"
- [ ] **Verbalize vision**: "Realize [essential value] through [differentiated method] in [long-term sustainable form]"

### When Deciding Project Priorities

Evaluate each project on two axes:

| Project | Essential Value (First Principles) | Long-term Regret (RM) | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A: Flashy new feature | Low | Low | Low |
| B: Quality improvement | High | High | High |
| C: Process improvement | Medium | Medium | Medium |

- [ ] What is the essential value? (First principles thinking)
- [ ] Will I regret not doing it in 10 years? (Regret minimization)
- [ ] Prioritize projects high in both

### Regular Self-Questioning (Annual Review)

In the annual review from [@vision-to-execution], ask three questions:

- [ ] **"Will my 10-years-from-now self be proud of this year's decisions?"** - Evaluate vision, implementation, short-term temptations
- [ ] **"What would my 80-year-old self say to my current self?"** - Practice regret minimization
- [ ] **"Am I thinking from first principles now?"** - Confirm whether questioning assumptions and pursuing essence

## Summary: Will You Be Proud of Today's Decision in 10 Years?

The decision-making series ends with this article. From [@uncertainty-strategic-framework] to [@vision-to-execution], everything has been directed toward one purpose: **defining the "right thing" to realize and acquiring the power to implement it**.

However, the most important question remains:

**"What are you following to make decisions now?"**

- Competitors' moves?
- Boss's expectations?
- Quarterly numbers?

Or,

- Users' essential needs?
- Choices you'll be proud of in 10 years?

First principles thinking asks "What is essentially correct?" and regret minimization asks "Why should we do this now?" By integrating the two, a solid vision emerges that is "essentially correct and won't be regretted long-term."

In the AI era, short-term temptations will continue to increase. That's precisely why **the power to make decisions with long-term perspective** becomes the most important weapon for system architects.

Will you be proud of today's decision in 10 years?
